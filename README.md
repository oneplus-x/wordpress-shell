wordpress-shell
===============

Cheap &amp; Nasty Wordpress Command Execution Shell.

Execute Commands as the webserver you are serving wordpress with!
Uploaded shell will probably be at <host>/wp-content/plugins/shell/shell.php

Install
=======
To install the shell, we are assuming you have administrative access to the Wordpress install and can install plugins.
Either upload the zip file located in the `dist/` directory, or create your own archive with:

```bash
λ wordpress-shell → λ git master → zip -r shell.zip shell.php
  adding: shell.php (deflated 39%)
  
λ wordpress-shell → λ git master → ls -lah shell.zip
-rw-r--r--  1 bob  staff   492B Aug 29 14:17 shell.zip
```

Once uploaded, navigate to `/wp-content/plugins/shell/shell.php` and provide the `cmd` argument.

Sample Usage
============
